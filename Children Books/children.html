        <p>It’s not easy being Zarf. As a troll, he’s stuck at the bottom of the middle school popularity list, way below the prince and knights the popular ones, ogres and giants the jocks, and even the minstrels the band geeks. Plus, trolls aren’t exactly known for their brain power or coolness. But it gets worse. When the king disappears and Zarf’s enemy, the prince, takes up the throne, he makes Zarf’s life even more miserable. So  Zarf and his two sidekicks, a neurotic, mutton-obsessed pig and the not-funny son of the court jester, set out to find the missing king as well as their way to middle school heroism.  </p>

        <p>Ever since the monster apocalypse hit town, 13 year old Jack Sullivan has been living in his tree house, which has been heavily armed with catapults  and a huge supply of Oreos and Mountain Dew stolen from abandoned stores. But Jack alone is no match for the hoards of Zombies, Winged Wretches, Vine Thingies, and especially not for the eerily intelligent monster known only as <i>Blarg.</i> So Jack builds a team: his dorky best friend, Quint; the reformed middle school bully, Dirk; Jack's pet monster, Rover; and Jack's crush, June. With their help, Jack can slay Blarg and achieve the ultimate Feat of Apocalyptic Success. </p>

        <p>Some Pig. Humble. Radiant. These are the words in Charlotte's Web, high up in Zuckerman's barn. Charlotte's spiderweb tells of her feelings for a little pig named Wilbur, who simply wants a friend. They also express the love of a girl named Fern, who saved Wilbur's life when he was born the runt of his litter.  </p>
